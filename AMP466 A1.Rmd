First of all, we load the dataset for selected bond prices
```{r}
bondprice <- read.csv("A1.csv")
```

# 4(a) Since except for CAN 0.75 Jan 31 24 and CAN 1.5 Aug 31 24 whose terms are 7 months apart, all other bondsâ€™ terms are 6 months apart from each other, using semi-annual compounding instead of instantaneous compounding seems more appropriate. I will use today as Jan 31 2022 to calculate YTM. This only 1 months difference can be negligible in this case, so I will use 6 months term difference to calculate everything.  
```{r}
# Need to calculate the dirty prices before move on the calculate YTM
# clean price is the price from market data, n is the number of days from the last coupon payment to the data when clean price is quoted, here we build a function to calculate dirty price of bonds
dirtyprice <- function(cleanprice, n) {
  dp <- cleanprice + n/365
  return(dp)
}

# Now we calculate all the dirty prices
dp1.10 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.10,bondprice$nto1.10)
dp1.11 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.11,bondprice$nto1.11)
dp1.12 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.12,bondprice$nto1.12)
dp1.13 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.13,bondprice$nto1.13)
dp1.14 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.14,bondprice$nto1.14)
dp1.17 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.17,bondprice$nto1.17)
dp1.18 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.18,bondprice$nto1.18)
dp1.19 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.19,bondprice$nto1.19)
dp1.20 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.20,bondprice$nto1.20)
dp1.21 <- dirtyprice(bondprice$X2022.1.21,bondprice$nto1.21)

# Create a new data frame consists only of dirty prices
dirtyp <- cbind(dp1.10, dp1.11, dp1.12, dp1.13, dp1.14, dp1.17, dp1.18, dp1.19, dp1.20, dp1.21)

# changes the row names of dirty prices to the bond names
rownames(dirtyp) <-bondprice$Name
```

# Now we have the dirty prices, we will calculate YTM by the formula dirty price = sigma pi*(1+ytm/n)^-ti*n, in our case, all bonds are semi-annual compounding so n = 2.
```{r}
# Now we build  functions to calculate YTM 
# First we build a function to create cash flow, cp represents coupon payment, nc is the number of total coupon payment, then we add 100 which is the face value at the end. Coupon payment of each bond is already calculated and listed in the last column of table "bondprice"
cashflow <- function(cp, nc, dp) {
  # build a vector of length number of coupon payments+1
  cf <- vector(, nc+1)
  # replace all elements of the elements with coupon payment
  cf <- replace(cf,,cp)
  # replace the last element with coupon payment + face value
  cf[length(cf)] <- cp+100
  # replace the first element with negative dirty price
  cf[1] = -dp
  return(cf)
}

# Create bond valuation function
bval <- function(i, cf,
     t=seq(along = cf))
  # write out the valuation equation
     sum(cf / (1 + i)^t)

# Create ytm() function using uniroot
ytm <- function(cf) {
    uniroot(bval, c(0, 1), cf = cf)$root
}

# It quite surprises me that the bond CAN 0.25 Jul 31 22 that matures in 6 months from Today(Jan 31) has negative yield when I use dirty price to calculate. Since there is only 1 coupon payment left(the one right before date of maturity), and the coupon payment is too low 0.25% annually, 0.125% semi-annually. Further it makes sense that current interest rate is really low, thus the return of this bond is really low, resulting in the bond price to be  high to have a negative yield.

# since the above ytm functions works a little weird to me on that negative yield bond
# Build another ytm calculator for this bond CAN 0.25 Jul 31 22
# Here, dp is dirty price and cf is coupon payment + face value
ytm1 <- function(dp,cf) {
  # ytm of this bond is simply (last coupon payment + face value)/dirty price -1
  ytm1 <- cf/dp -1
  return(ytm1)
}
```

# Now, I have build all the tools needed to calculate ytm. I will do the calculations now
```{r}
# calculate the ytm of bond CAN 0.25 Jul 31 22 using ytm1 function since it has negative yield
ytmCAN0.25Jul3122 <- ytm1(dirtyp[1,],100.125)

# We know that the spot rate of bonds which mature within a year, the spot rate is equal to its ytm. So we can easily calculate this spot rate. Then, we use bootstrapping. Since we know the dirty price, cash flow of bonds, the 0.5 year spot curve and the face value. The only unkonwn in the bootstapping equation the next spot rate and it is calculatable in this case.
```{r}
# First we calculate the spot rate at time 0.5, here dp is dirty price of bond CAN 0.25 Jul 31 22, t is time and since we already know the face value of all bonds are 100, we do not include a face value variable in the function

However, we can see a number (in red bracket) in the two largest vector has different sign. These two values correspond to ytm of bonds matures in 1 year and 2 years and 1yr-1yr forward rate. Both rates are calculated from bond CAN 0.25 Jan 31 23 & CAN 0.75 Jan 31 24. And since the bond matures in 2 years was issued on 10/21/2022, so there is no previous coupon payment, thus there is no dirty price for this bond. Hence the ytm and spot rate at t = 2, differ from the trend significantly (Can see this in my plots of 4(a) and 4(b). 

Further, the coupon payment for the 1-year and 2- year bonds differ significantly as well. Although there is no insane coupon rate like 6% or something, the latter rate is still 3 times the front one.
